> Apple Review是每个开发者心中的一片沼泽地, 过了这篇沼泽地，又迎来下一片沼泽地。

## IAP内购-游客
IAP内购最好支持一下游客否则接着拒5.1.1，来看看

### GuidelineGuideline 5.1.1 - Legal - Privacy - Data Collection and Storage


We noticed that your app requires users to register with personal information to purchase non account-based in-app purchase products, which does not comply with the App Store Review Guidelines.

Apps cannot require user registration prior to allowing access to app content and features that are not associated specifically to the user.

Next Steps

User registration that requires the sharing of personal information must be optional or tied to account-specific functionality.

To resolve this issue, please make it clear to the user that registering will enable them to access the content from any of their iOS devices and provide them a way to register at any time, if they wish to later extend access to additional iOS devices.

Please note that although guideline 3.1.2 of the App Store Review Guidelines requires an app to make subscription content available to all the iOS devices owned by a single user, it is not appropriate to force user registration to meet this requirement; such user registration must be made optional.

苹果认为内购无需强制用户登录，如果你的产品设计强制登录购买，这次不拒，下次再拒。看优酷的教科书的UI设计，应该很懂IAP审核的痛，上图
